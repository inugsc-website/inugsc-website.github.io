# INUGSC website
This website works through GitHub Pages.
It's simply static HTML, CSS, and JS files. Making changes should therefore be pretty simple.

## Changing the committee
The page with all the committee members is generated client-side, using the file *people.txt*. Therefore, if you want to change someone's details, you should do it using *people.txt* and not by editing the HTML of that page.

## Changing other details
Each of these files has instructions on how to make the appropriate changes.
### Speakers
Edit the file *speakers.txt*.
### Workshops
Edit the file *workshops.txt*.
### Sponsors
Edit the file *sponsors.txt*.

## When tickets are available
Edit the file *tickets.txt*. It has instructions on what changes you should make.
