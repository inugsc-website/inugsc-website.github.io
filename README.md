# INUGSC website
This website works through GitHub Pages.
It's simply static HTML, CSS, and JS files. Making changes should therefore be pretty simple.

## Changing the committee
The page with all the committee members is generated client-side, using the file *people.txt*. Therefore, if you want to change someone's details, you should do it using *people.txt* and not by editing the HTML of that page.
