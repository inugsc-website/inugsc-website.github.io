/img/Lung_Lobectomy.png
Lung Lobectomy
Learn the key steps of open lung lobectomy in a high-fidelity, hands-on cardiothoracic surgery simulation. Practise exposure, hilar dissection, vessel control, and bronchial division using real lung specimens within a 3D-printed rib cage model. The workshop follows the structure of the operation and runs in small groups with close guidance. An immersive, technique-focused session designed to bring thoracic surgery principles to life.
-
/img/Aortic_Valve_Replacement.png
Aortic Valve Replacement
Take on the challenge of aortic valve replacement in this immersive hands-on workshop. You’ll work with a “faulty” aorta, excise the diseased valve, and prepare a prosthetic replacement. Learn to seat the valve with precision, secure it properly, and complete a full valve replacement from start to finish.
-
/img/Sebaceous_Cyst_Excision.png
Sebaceous Cyst Excision
Master the art of minor surgery in our Sebaceous Cyst Excision workshop! Students will work on simulated models — removing embedded cysts from pig skin — while honing their precision in incision planning, careful dissection, and suturing techniques.
-
/img/Laparoscopic_Appendicectomy.png
Laparoscopic Appendicectomy
Experience keyhole surgery by performing a simulated appendicectomy! Use laparoscopic box trainers to practise camera control, handling instruments, cutting, and clipping while removing an appendix model. Great for anyone curious about minimally invasive surgery.
-
/img/Cardiac_Pacing_and_Ablation.png
Cardiac Pacing and Ablation
This hands-on workshop provides delegates with an introduction to the principles of cardiac electrophysiology. Using the Epicardio simulator, delegates will deepen their understanding of cardiac anatomy, the conduction system, ECG in normal and arrhythmic states. Through structured simulation tasks,  this session aims to develop skills in temporary pacing, implanted pacing and ablation techniques.
-
/img/C-Section.png
Caesarean Section
Simulate a Caesarean section using layered models that mimic real tissue. Practise making incisions, identifying layers, delivering the baby, and closing the wound using common suturing techniques in a safe, supportive learning environment.
-
/img/Anastomosis.png
Vascular Anastomosis
Step into the world of vascular surgery in this workshop! This hands-on workshop introduces core principles of vascular anastomosis using realistic simulation models. Delegates will learn end-to-end, end-to- side, and side-to-side techniques, refining suturing precision, needle control, and tissue handling in a surgically focused training environment.
-
/img/K_Wiring.png
K-Wiring
Learn the fundamentals of upper limb fracture fixation using K-wires. Practise fracture reduction, wire placement, and safe technique on realistic bone models, with guidance from clinicians. Perfect for beginners interested in orthopaedics and surgical skills.
-
/img/Mandibular_Plating.png
Mandibular Plating
This interactive workshop immerses delegates in mandibular trauma management through a simulated fracture scenario. Participants will plan fracture realignment and perform mandibular plating on a model, applying principles used in real surgery. The session builds spatial awareness, fixation strategy, and precise instrument handling within a structured, hands-on maxillofacial surgical simulation environment.
-
/img/Keratoplasty.png
Keratoplasty
Ever wanted to feel what eye surgery is like? This corneal transplant workshop teaches corneal transplantation through realistic simulation using porcine eyes. Delegates will perform key operative steps, developing microsurgical handling, suturing precision, and tissue manipulation skills while gaining confidence in delicate ophthalmic techniques.
-
/img/Total_Knee_Replacement.png
Total Knee Replacement
In this hands-on workshop, delegates will use sawbone models and authentic orthopaedic instruments to simulate a complete knee replacement procedure. Participants will follow key operative steps while developing practical skills in alignment, instrument handling, and procedural flow, gaining confidence and technical insight within a realistic, structured surgical simulation setting.
-
/img/Inguinal_Hernia_Repair.png
Inguinal Hernia Repair
This hands-on workshop uses a student-developed inguinal hernia model to simulate the key surgical steps of hernia repair. Delegates will explore anatomy, practice tissue handling, and follow procedural flow while developing suturing precision and operative confidence in a structured simulation.
-
/img/Kidney_Transplant.png
Kidney Transplant
This practical workshop guides delegates through the key stages of kidney transplantation before hands-on practice using a porcine model. Participants will attach the kidney to new vessels, developing vascular anastomosis techniques, refining suturing precision, and strengthening delicate hand–eye coordination in a focused, realistic surgical simulation environment.
-
/img/Digital_Toe_Amputation.png
Digital Toe Amputation
In this hands-on workshop, participants will perform a simulated digital toe amputation using a pig model. You’ll gain experience in soft-tissue dissection, bone transection, and practicing fundamental wound closure techniques.
-
/img/Laminectomy.png
Laminectomy
This practical workshop guides delegates through the essential steps of lumbar laminectomy using anatomical models. Participants will simulate spinal decompression, refining bone removal techniques, instrument handling while building confidence in a structured, realistic surgical simulation setting.
-
/img/Basic_and_Advanced_Suturing.png
Basic and Advanced Suturing
Whether you’re picking up a needle holder for the first time or refining your technique, this basic and advanced suturing session is designed to build real confidence. You’ll start by learning proper instrument handling, placing clean interrupted sutures, and achieving secure wound closure. From there, you’ll progress to advanced techniques, including simple continuous sutures, horizontal and vertical mattress sutures.
-
/img/Battle_of_the_Specialties.png
Battle of the Specialties (BOTS)
Still torn between specialties? Battle of the Specialties throws you into the heart of the action. You’ll rotate through hands-on stations led by vascular, general and transplant surgeons, ENT, and neurosurgery—each highlighting their core techniques and day-to-day surgical skills. It’s fast- paced, immersive, and designed to help you compare specialties side by side while discovering what really excites you in surgery.
-
/img/Surgical_Hackathon.png
Surgical Hackathon
This surgical hackathon session challenges teams to design a theoretical workshop that simulates a surgical procedure. Participants must consider cost, sustainability, and reproducibility while developing their concept. The session promotes creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork, highlighting how thoughtful simulation design can enhance surgical education and accessibility.
